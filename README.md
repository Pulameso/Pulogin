AutoHotkey script for quickly switching accounts in Steam. Store up to 3 accounts, dude. It's sick.

Make a folder containing ALL 3 items and store it somewhere. 
To have the script run at Windows startup, create a shortcut of the .exe file and put it here: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp

You will have to set your Steam directory path. Either change it in the .ini file or change it via the applications setting window.
